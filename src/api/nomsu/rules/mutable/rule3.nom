### The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive) points. In the case of 
    multiple players achieving this threshold at the same time, the player with highest
    points is the winner. In the case there a multiple players with the exact same
    highest score, the player who first reached that score is the winner. While the 
    aforementioned logic is super-immutable, the value of the threshold can be changed
    by ammendments to this rule.
