## The legend of "Tezos-Nomic"

Tezos supports meta upgrades: the protocols can evolve by amending their own code. This is not unlike philosopher Peter Suberâ€™s Nomic, a game built around a fully introspective set of rules that are changed and develop as the game progresses. Actually, the idea for Tezos was based on Nomic.

## How it works

Schrodinger's Cup consists of a website, API, and Tezos smart contracts. Play sessions are conducted daily, the duration and timing of which is coded into the orignal rule set stored on Tezos. However, just like any other rule of Nomic they can be updated during game play. 

## NFTs and Esports

Players who successfully perform an in-game action (changing the rules, voting, etc.) receive a Tezos NFT for playing. Additionally, players with the top highest scores are ranked by the NFT distribution system. These ranking NFTs contain a zero knowledge proof attribute which can be used to calculate and prove their final ranking on the overall Nomic ELO ladder. Proofs for ELO tokens can be updated later as the player participates in future games of Nomic, providing the basis for the first long term ELO / Glicko-2 style ladder ranking built on blockchain technology.

The overall winner of the Nomic game receives an XTZ reward transferred to their wallet in the same operation as mints their ranking NFT.

## Why
We hope to produce a blockchain game that's entertaining but psychologically intense, and that educates players about how Tezos actually works. Additionally, our NFT and rewards distribution system presents a reasonable implementation to show how esports tournament ladders can be run on blockchain technology.

## Pre-game Warmup

After connecting with your wallet you'll see a countdown to the next game of Nomic. Game play sessions are held played daily at 16:00 UTC until a winner is declared in the contract.

In between game play sessions, you'll want to brush up on your skills for dealing with our game's meta-programming language called [Nomsu] (https://nomsu.org/). At https://nomic.schrodingerscup.com/practice you can test compiling some rules as well as save or queue them for use in the next game session.

## The Game Knows Who You Are

Before joining an active game play session, users are required to sign a message proving ownership of their Tezos address. This allows the game to initiate transactions to the game smart contract using the API server Server wallet, and keeps it a "free-to-play" game. Additionally, it provides security to ensure nobody else can claim your wallet address as a display name in the game chat.

## Live Game Play

In an active game the order of turns is the same as the order in which players joined the game session. Once a rule has been proposed by the "first joiner", a voting interface is presented to each other player above the game chat.

<br/>

Clicking the "Show rule code" button displays a side-by-side if a previously confirmed rule is being changed or a display of the rule code being added if the proposal is a new rule candidate. If the proposal is to delete or transmute a previous rule only that current rule code is shown.

As defined in [Mutable Rule 0](https://github.com/Chain-of-Insight/schrodingers-cup/blob/master/src/api/nomsu/rules/mutable/rule0.nom) (at the outset of the game at least) everyone will need to vote before triggering a decision, but while you're waiting on those slow-pokes you can watch the vote results in real time ðŸ˜Ž

Once there is a quorum of votes is arrived at the API server will update the game chat with results of the round.

Once a rule change occurs that triggers a game over event the API wallet initiates an operation on the game contract which transfers an NFT reward to the winning player. [Example operation](https://better-call.dev/search?text=oocc7Sz4nyaCcn9ucz5NEru9dop7Ugsyc6LN4PEhghptfoFEhiH)
